            <h3>Initial Concept</h3>
            <p>
              My starting idea for the Discovery Project was to build a practical circuit that forced me to
              understand switching behavior, inductors, and real-world non-ideal components. A boost converter
              is perfect for that: it is widely used in battery-powered electronics to step up voltage, and its
              behavior is strongly tied to core ECE concepts.
            </p>
            <p>
              The target was simple on paper: design a converter that takes <strong>5V in</strong> and boosts it
              to roughly <strong>15V out</strong> using an inductor, MOSFET, diode, and output capacitor,
              controlled by a PWM signal.

        <p>
          The simulation predicted a noticeable startup overshoot followed by a decaying ripple as the output settled.
          When I tested the real circuit, I observed a very similar shape on the oscilloscope, which gave me confidence
          that the model and component choices were reasonable.

                <strong>Overshoot:</strong> Initially saw a higher-than-expected peak voltage.
                This led me to think about soft-start and ramping duty cycle more gently.

                <strong>Ripple and ringing:</strong> Breadboard parasitics and long leads introduced ringing
                that was not as strong in simulation, highlighting layout as a key next step.

              <li>
                <strong>Diode losses:</strong> The ES3A’s forward drop reduces efficiency; in a next revision I’d

    <!-- FINAL THOUGHTS -->

        <h2>Final Thoughts &amp; Future Work</h2>
        <p>
          Overall, this Discovery Project made power electronics feel much more concrete. Instead of just seeing
          the boost converter equation in a slide, I watched the inductor current ramp, the diode conduct, and the
          output voltage settle into place. It also showed me how important layout, parasitics, and component
          selection are if I ever want to ship a design instead of just simulating it.
        </p>
        <p>
          This experience strengthened my interest in the <strong>Power &amp; Electronics</strong> side of ECE.
          In the future, I’d like to design a PCB version of this converter, add proper feedback regulation,
          and measure real efficiency across load conditions. That would turn this Discovery Project into a
          stepping stone for more advanced converter designs.
