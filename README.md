# ePortfolio Starter (Static HTML/CSS/JS)

This is a clean, single-page starter you can publish quickly. It includes all **required sections** for the ECE 1100 ePortfolio:
Home, About, Resume, Career Goals, Projects (with a Discovery Project placeholder), and Contact.

## How to Edit
- Open `index.html` and replace the placeholder text with your own content.
- Put your PDF resume at `assets/Krishiv_Aggarwal_Resume.pdf` (keep the same filename).
- Add images (PNG/JPG) in `/assets` and place them into the Projects or About sections.

## Option A — Publish with GitHub Pages (Free)
1. Create a new public repository on GitHub named `eportfolio` (or any name).
2. Upload all files from this folder (index.html, style.css, script.js, and the assets folder).
3. In the repo, go to **Settings → Pages**.
4. Under **Build and deployment**, set **Source** to **Deploy from a branch**.
5. Set **Branch** to `main` and **/root`** then **Save**.
6. Wait ~1 minute. Your site will be live at:
   - `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`

## Option B — Publish with Netlify Drop (Fastest Drag-and-Drop)
1. Go to https://app.netlify.com/drop
2. Drag the entire folder onto the page to deploy.
3. You’ll get a live URL like `https://your-site-name.netlify.app` you can submit.

## Option C — Publish with Neocities (Drag-and-Drop, Minimal Setup)
1. Create a free account at https://neocities.org/
2. Upload all files; your site goes live at `https://<username>.neocities.org`.

### Tips to Meet Assignment Requirements
- Ensure you have **≥1000 words** across sections and **≥5 images/graphics**.
- For the Discovery Project, include ~**500 words**, images, and (optionally) a short demo video.
- Keep the site publicly accessible and verify all links work before submitting.
